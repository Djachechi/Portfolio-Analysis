With Python and Pandas created an analysis notebook that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of portfolios. Using historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. You will then use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500 Index).
